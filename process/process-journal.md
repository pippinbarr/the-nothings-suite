# First thoughts (Tuesday, 22 December 2020, 11:12AM)

It's been a fast-paced project. I started it officially yesterday morning and since then I've accumulated 11 nothings. That's a whole lot of nothing.

Currently the big one I'm missing in the Unreal Engine, which I can't install on my laptop as it takes up too much space. I *can* release this suite without it, but it does feel a bit fundamental, so I'm pondering ways to deal with that. Seems like Unreal does have a web export ([community supported](https://github.com/UnrealEngineHTML5/Documentation)), so that would mean I could potentially create this version on the gaming laptop rather than install Unreal on this MacBook Pro.

It has felt nice to be so "productive" in terms of churning out different engines' ideas of nothing. They do tend to differ in significant ways, which I'm glad of - it's not just a series of blank screens that don't tell you much. There is, unsurprisingly *something there*. Duh duh duh! Big reveal music effect here.

I feel like this project could be subject to a bunch of different forms of analysis, including some kind of code forensics, as well as the basic aesthetics of the nothing, as well as some of the signification of producing nothing, as well as the processual aspects of producing nothing. I can probably do some basic versions of all of these things here. It's going to make the most sense to write an engine-by-engine review of the nothing experience I assume.

That's a bit of a larger bite than I want to take out of it this morning, but I'll perhaps write a bit about it later today or tomorrow while it remains at least somewhat fresh.
