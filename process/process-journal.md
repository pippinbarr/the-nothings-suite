# First thoughts (Tuesday, 22 December 2020, 11:12AM)

It's been a fast-paced project. I started it officially yesterday morning and since then I've accumulated 11 nothings. That's a whole lot of nothing.

Currently the big one I'm missing in the Unreal Engine, which I can't install on my laptop as it takes up too much space. I *can* release this suite without it, but it does feel a bit fundamental, so I'm pondering ways to deal with that. Seems like Unreal does have a web export ([community supported](https://github.com/UnrealEngineHTML5/Documentation)), so that would mean I could potentially create this version on the gaming laptop rather than install Unreal on this MacBook Pro.

It has felt nice to be so "productive" in terms of churning out different engines' ideas of nothing. They do tend to differ in significant ways, which I'm glad of - it's not just a series of blank screens that don't tell you much. There is, unsurprisingly *something there*. Duh duh duh! Big reveal music effect here.

I feel like this project could be subject to a bunch of different forms of analysis, including some kind of code forensics, as well as the basic aesthetics of the nothing, as well as some of the signification of producing nothing, as well as the processual aspects of producing nothing. I can probably do some basic versions of all of these things here. It's going to make the most sense to write an engine-by-engine review of the nothing experience I assume.

That's a bit of a larger bite than I want to take out of it this morning, but I'll perhaps write a bit about it later today or tomorrow while it remains at least somewhat fresh.

# Twine and Inky (Wednesday, 23 December 2020, 10:32AM)

Alright well, as promised I thought I'd write some notes about the specific instances of Nothing I've created so far. I also realized a number of Nothings not yet made like Godot and Adventure Game Studio, so I'll get onto those where possible. Anyway, on with specific notes, roughly in order of creation? Or no just in some order.

## Twine

Should I be listing specific version numbers of software? No I don't think that's all that important, this isn't an archival effort, though it has a kind of archiving flavour.

Twine involved firing up the software and then exporting it to HTML. The project gets titled Nothing, which displays as the page title in the browser. The default Twine starting point has a single text node with default text in it "Double-click this passage to edit it.". It displays in the default CSS, it has no links and is not interactive.

I quite like that there is content here and that the content explicitly references the process of making a Twine game, even if it's an instruction the player cannot follow. It really marks the distinction between creation and play in a neat and tidy way, the ability to change the game versus the ability to play the game.

As with many of the Nothings, I like that it's *not* nothing too, of course, and that's a recurring theme. It's not a blank page. As with any Twine, under the hood is the actually Twine JavaScript as well, so it's a 295KB file despite being just some text on the screen. I don't know enough about Twine to know whether the JS is reading data in from the page and then rendering it to the screen or not. When I inspect the page I see the same tags etc. so I think this particular passage, being the starting passage, is pre-rendered into the HTML, which makes the JS actually completely non-functional (except that it may well still be doing some stuff on startup anyway?). Looking through the minified code doesn't tell me a lot - I can't find a `window.onload` anywhere to most obviously suggest there's code running from the very beginning, ... oh wait, there it is. There's an `addEventListener` for "DOMContentLoaded", so it's likely there's JavaScript running on the page, even if it's not "needed". Such is life for game engines. They can't know in advance what content you're providing for them to interpret, so they have to try to interpret what's there, even if it turns out not to need interpreting.

So, quite a lot of nothing going on with this one. I think the reveal of the inner part of the application through its default "Double-click here" message is really nice for this one. The creation application shows up explicitly (through language) in the played artifact.

## Inky

Inky isn't a tool I've ever used to actually make something, though I've played a few Inky games I believe. The nothing in this case is just the word "nothing" in a pleasing font, representing the title of the "story". Actually, this is true of Twine too to some extent, but there's something worth noticing about the fact that in the context of this tool what we're seeing is a *story* of Nothing rather than a game per se?

An immediately noticeable extra part here is that there's a link at the top of the page "WRITTEN IN INK" that links to the "ink" page on the inklestudios website. So this is another way of referring to the tool of production, but more explicit, more like advertising. I quite like the accessibility implications of this, even if it's perhaps not so artistically satisfying as a hermetically sealed story in a webpage. Someone looking at this story (or a less nothing one) gets to find the tool itself if they're interested in crossing over.

The source code for the Inky version shows very simple HTML as well as linking to three separate JS files. There's `ink.js` which is presumably the ink engine itself, obfuscated via minification. Can't make much of it at all. There's also `Nothing.js` which is interesting given that the story has no content at all. It contains the following:

```javascript
var storyContent = ï»¿{"inkVersion":19,"root":[[["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}};
```

Most of that is mystifying (especially the `#f`s), but you can see it's roughly speaking just the base level data structure for the story and contains almost nothing. Not nothing though.

`main.js`, the last source file, is not minified and is not super long and is even commented! Can see that a `continueStory()` function is being called to kick off the story, which presumably stalls out when it finds out there's no data. It's interesting how little code there seems to be here in the main script to drive the engine forwards - feels like a neat package, all the action is in `ink.js` I guess.

Also of note with Inkle, the software I used to make this, is that I couldn't export the "nothing" it starts out with. The program loads with a blank page, but I couldn't export it to HTML until I typed a character, saved it, deleted it, and saved it again. So there was this sense I had to really consciously signal I wanted the nothing that was already there. Raises the question of whether it's still "nothing" if I had to exert this particular effort to get it to a releasable state, even if that state is (roughly speaking) the same as the starting state? Is there a ghost of that character (I think it was an "e") that I typed hovering over this project?
