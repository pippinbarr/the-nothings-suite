# The Nothings Suite

*Nothing to see here! But don't move along! You can really see the nothing here! Examine the nothing! Think about the nothing! The nothing is where it all begins!*

_The Nothings Suite_ is a collection of (extremely) short videogames made with diverse videogame engines such as Unity, Twine, and PICO-8. In each case, a game has been produced with the engine using, as much as possible, no creative input at all. That is, in the ideal scenario I open the game engine, save the project it creates by default as "Nothing" and export it for play. This means you get to see each game engine's idea of what "nothing" (or at least no effort) looks like when you set out to make a game with it.

#### [Nothing](https://pippinbarr.github.io/the-nothings-suite/twine/) (Twine)

[Twine](http://twinery.org/) is a flexible hypertext creation tool. The minimal Twine game is a single webpage with default styling containing the instruction: *"Double-click this passage to edit it."* This is the only engine profiled here that references its own user interface by default, pointing the nothing-player to the underlying idea of *making* a Twine game.

#### [Nothing](https://pippinbarr.github.io/the-nothings-suite/inky/) (Inky)

[Inky](https://github.com/inkle/inky/releases/tag/0.12.0) is the editor for the [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) scripting language, used to write interactive fiction. This Nothing is interesting for the way it promotes its own tool, proclaiming *"WRITTEN IN INK"* at the top of its webpage. To actually export this this empty Ink story, I had to first write a character, save the file, then delete it and save again. Is it really nothing, or does the ghost of that character remain?

#### [Nothing](https://pippinbarr.github.io/the-nothings-suite/bitsy/) (Bitsy)

[Bitsy Game Maker](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) (by Adam LeDoux) is an accessible tool for creating "little games or worlds", generally in low resolution 2D visuals. The "nothing" produced here is extensive, containing a title screen, an avatar the player can navigate around a room, and a cat for them to talk to (*"I'm a cat"*). This impressively "playable" nothing is telling the accessibility of the tool: these elements are in place by default so that a user new to the Bitsy Game Maker is able to quickly edit the visuals and texts already in place to begin their own project.

#### [Nothing](https://pippinbarr.github.io/the-nothings-suite/flickgame/) (Flickgame)

[Flickgame](https://www.flickgame.org/) by [Increpare](https://www.increpare.com/index.html) is an ultra-accessible tool for creating a game made up of hyperlinked hand-drawn images, where links between pages are based on colors. This "nothing" is an empty aubergine purple rectangle that links to nothing, the absence of a drawing and the absence of links. The exported HTML file is only 17KB, the smallest (potentially) interactive nothing in this collection. The source code is also quite readable in the HTML, emphasizing Increpare's commitment to open source with this tool ([repository here](https://github.com/increpare/flickgame)).

#### [Nothing](https://pippinbarr.github.io/the-nothings-suite/puzzlescript/nothing.html) (PuzzleScript)

[PuzzleScript](https://www.puzzlescript.net/) is an open source puzzle game engine by [Increpare](https://www.increpare.com/index.html). This "nothing" is the only "playable game" in this overall suite in the traditional sense: a simple [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) level the player can interact with and complete (walkthrough: press the right arrow three times!). This is another nod to accessibility, in this case helping to explain to the user of PuzzleScript through example how its underlying scripting language works at its most fundamental. This is multi-layered nothing - with no additional level data, nor PuzzleScript, nor underlying JavaScript - pointing to the complexity of even "simple" tools.

#### [Nothing](https://pippinbarr.github.io/the-nothings-suite/pico8/) (PICO-8)

[PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is a "fantasy console" with an associated development environment for making limited but potential-filled small games. Producing this "nothing" was challenging because PICO-8 is less immediately "friendly" than other game engines, in keeping with its demand that you commit to its technical fantasy world. The nothingness here is due to an empty source code file (`.p8` extension) being used to "create" the resulting game. The game freezes at *"BOOTING CARTRIDGE..."*, but displays no errors either in the fantasy console or the JavaScript console. There's just nothing there for PICO-8 to do.

#### [Nothing](https://pippinbarr.github.io/the-nothings-suite/inform7/Nothing.gblorb) (Inform 7, downloadable `.gblorb` file, requires an interpreter)

[Inform 7](http://inform7.com/) is a "Design System for Interactive Fiction", prominently featuring a natural-language programming environment. The source code for this "nothing" is first the line `"Nothing" by Pippin Barr` and then the line `Example Location is a room.`, the default generated on creating a new project. Despite the almost total lack of content, the resulting game is expansive thanks to the nature of the Inform 7 engine. In particular, you can perform many actions in its world - such as jumping, talking, and looking at yourself (*"as good-looking as ever"*) - because the engine itself has so many default responses in place. Of course, this world is also incredible claustrophobic - the abyss of its nothingness shows.

**Note:** Because the only way to make an Inform 7 game playable in the browser is to add text to its existing code, I was unable to make it accessible in that way. Instead, you'll have to download the `.gblorb` file and play it with an *interpreter*. Consider [Spatterlight](http://ccxvii.net/spatterlight/) (Mac), [Filfre](http://maher.filfre.net/filfre/index.html) (Windows), or [Gargoyle](http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/) (Linux).
